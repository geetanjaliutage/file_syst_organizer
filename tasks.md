# kick Edges for webd
//at each step write pseudo code first and then to impleent it create   functions
//google search

# Edge kicks of organize
//valid command----------
//if dirpath is not given------------
//if given path is not valid-----------
//only for folders not for files---------
//check if organized folder present already ,if not create---------------------------
//now using organized folder
  for each file in given dir check ext (for file only not folder)----------------
  get type from extension(if type is not present don't do anything)-------------
  if ext matches from given types then send file to that type folder---------------(only if it is not present there)
  creater that typefolder/subfolder if not present------------
  now delete the original file---------------
  while copy and cutting fromsrc to dest double double na krna-------(copyFileSync overwrites) 
//relative path???????????----------(process.cwd)

# Edge kicks for tree
//recursion is used------------ 
//file is base case------------
//folder helps in continuing recursion-------------

# Edge kicks for making global(putting in cmd)
//shebang syntax google search
(#!/usr/bin/env node)-------now your os(cmd )in which environment it has to run the command(put at the start of script file->main.js)
//Using npm init -y ->package.json
=>file contains info on the project itself such as name and version num. Listed alongside this information are the projectâ€™s dependencies.------- 

//npm link ->package-lock.json------------
=>(links with cmd by creating)

# Edge kicks for good practice
//divide your project code into modules(like here i will put help,tree organize in diff js file in command dir)---------
//linking from modules(module.exports)
//linking in main import modules by require


#
//optimization from sir's code
=>help me fso not(node main.js)
//keep the code minimal in node.js
